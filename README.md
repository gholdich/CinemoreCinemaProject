This project is being developed using the MERN stack.;
npm install react-portal-tooltip;
npm install react-simple-dropdown;

To run this website, your computer must have nodejs and mongodb installed. Once downloaded the folders, you must have mongodb running. You can do this by navigating to the folder where the mongo executables are stored and running 'mongod.exe'. Leave this command prompt open.

In the root of the project folder and in the client folder,you must run 'npm install' in a command prompt to install the relevant node modules described in the package.json.

After this, to populate the database, you must run 'node mongooseSchema.js' in the root folder. This builds collections in your local mongo database which the website will use to get information, using the file 'mongooseSchema.js'.

Finally you can start compiling the website by running 'npm start' in the root of the folder. The browser should open automatically.
